**Data Cleaning, Transformation, and Business Analysis Project
**About the Project
This is a self-initiated project focused on practicing and showcasing data cleaning, transformation, and business problem-solving skills using Python (pandas) and Power BI.
All work was done independently without following any guided projects.

Files Included
uncleaned_data.csv — Raw dataset before any cleaning or processing.

cleaned_data.csv — Final dataset after cleaning and transformation.

Power BI Dashboard (.pbix) — Interactive dashboard created to solve a real-world business problem.

Objective
The main goal of this project was to:

Clean and transform a raw dataset for analysis.

Develop insights to solve a specific business problem.

Build an interactive dashboard in Power BI to visualize findings and support decision-making.

Business Problem
The business problem was to analyze customer data to:

Identify valuable customer segments.

Understand purchasing behavior.

Highlight areas to improve customer retention and revenue growth.

Steps Performed
Data Cleaning & Transformation (Python pandas):

Loaded and inspected the raw data.

Handled missing values appropriately.

Renamed confusing or inconsistent columns.

Converted columns to correct data types (e.g., dates, numbers).

Created new calculated fields to add more meaning to the data.

Filtered out irrelevant records.

Business Analysis & Visualization (Power BI):

Built an interactive dashboard.

Created key performance indicators (KPIs).

Designed visuals to highlight customer behavior and patterns.
